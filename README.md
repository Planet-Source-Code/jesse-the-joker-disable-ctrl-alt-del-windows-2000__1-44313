## Disable Ctrl\+Alt\+Del Windows 2000\!\!\!\!


</div>

### Description

I swear it took forever to do this.... so i hope you appreciate my efforts in building this...the bas file included isn't mine but i thank whoever made it. This basically edits the registry to disable the Task List button on the ctrl alt del screen (at least that was my purpose) This prevents users from closing apps in that section.
